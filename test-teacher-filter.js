// Test script to verify teacher course filtering
// Run with: node test-teacher-filter.js

const fs = require('fs');

// Simple test to check if we can see console output
console.log('🔍 Testing teacher course filtering...');

// Instructions for manual testing
console.log(`
📋 MANUAL TESTING STEPS:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3004/teacher/laboratory/manage-courses
2. Open browser developer tools and check console logs
3. Look for these specific logs:
   - "🎓 Teacher Management Migration Status"
   - "📚 TEACHER FILTER VERIFICATION - Courses loaded"
   - Django backend logs with "🔍 COURSE FILTER"

4. Expected behavior:
   - Only courses created by the current logged-in teacher should appear
   - All teachers should only see their own courses
   - Backend should log teacher filtering information

5. Check Django backend logs for:
   - "🔍 COURSE FILTER - User: [user_id] ([email]), Role: teacher"
   - "📚 TEACHER WITH DRAFTS - Found X courses for teacher [user_id]"

🧪 TESTING COMPLETE - CHECK BROWSER AND BACKEND LOGS
